# Alexander Koldy's Portfolio

## Hello, welcome to my portfolio!

My name is **Alexander Koldy** and I am a senior mechanical engineering and computer science student at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and art. I am an **aspiring roboticist** with a strong interest in **mechanical design** and **controls**. Below, you will find some of my most recent robotics-related projects. If you are interested in learning more about my work, please send an email to koldy@cooper.edu (resume available upon request)!
