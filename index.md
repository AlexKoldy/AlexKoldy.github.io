# Alexander Koldy's Portfolio

## Hello, welcome to my portfolio!

My name is **Alexander Koldy** and I am a senior mechanical engineering and computer science student at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. I am an **aspiring roboticist** with a strong interest in **mechanical design** and **controls**. Below, you will find some of my most recent robotics-related projects. If you are interested in learning more about my work, please send an email to koldy@cooper.edu (resume available upon request)!

### Details
For my senior project, I originally wanted to develop a robot that could cook various meals. After analyzing the most important aspects of human cooking, I determined that  hands were most important to the many of the motions we as humans perform during the cooking process. This led me to explore dexterous manipulation in robotic end-effectors as a potential project. However, I realized that traditional (hard) robots, aren't exactly ideal for the kitchen settings: the kitchen has objects and liquids that can potentially damage traditional robotic systems if they aren't properly protected. Moreover, I realized that traditional robots need percise force-feedback in order to adequately move and manipulate easy-to-break objects such as eggs. This led me to explore soft robotics as a potential solution. Thus, my senior project, **Dexterous Manipulation with Soft-Robotic End-Effectors** was born.

So far, I have been involved with the mechanical design of soft robotic fingers. Together with my group, I design fingers and their molds in SolidWorks. I then 3D print the molds on my printer. In the Robotics Laboratory at The Cooper Union, we pour silicone into the molds and let it cure. This allows us to turn around different designs within about a day (with curing the silicone taking anywhere from 4 to 12 hours). Next semester, I will be working on developing more advanced finger designs, likely containing multiple pressure channels for added degrees-of-freedom (DoF). I will additonally be looking to add DoF by using small servos, which do not make any contact with the work enviornment or objects within it.
